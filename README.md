# Genetic_Algorithm_8_queen_problem

My attempt at solving the 8 queen problem using genetic algorithm

Procedure
Step 1: Random generation of the population
Step 2: Calculating the fitness value for each of the members of the population
Step 3: Calculating the probability for selection for each of the memebers
Step 4: Random selection of the members
Step 5: Reproduce to create a new member
Step 6: Mutate if possible
Step 7: Add new member to the new population
Step 8: Follow the previous steps until population with child containing the max value for fitness has been found
